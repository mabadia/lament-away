# Lament-away 

We've created a project that piggy backs off the knowledge accumilated in our experience of the fields of frondend and backend to create a full stack app. Lament-away is an app that allows users to complain or recommend based on their experience of an old job. The user creates an account and signs in using a screen name to keep the users anonymous if they choose to do so.
